# Magic8Balll
A thonny magic 8 ball repo


Big Picture: 
I want this project to ultimately become a magic 8 ball with a plethora of responses and answers that do not repeat once. It will give you a random answer based on any question you put into the program. 

First round:
I hope to accomplish a fully working magic 8 ball that will answer any yes or no question.

Test plan for first round:
For my test Iâ€™m going to ask the user to ask a yes or no question and have them answer it. If this works, I will build off the program and possibly edit it so the user cannot get the same answer twice in a row. If this works, I'll add more answers for more variety in the responses that are outputted by the computer.

Reflections and revisions:
I now want to edit the code so the user can get more answers.

Next steps:
My next step is to write the code so it doesnt repeat twice.
