# Magic8Balll
A thonny magic 8 ball repo


Big Picture: 
I want this project to ultimately become a magic 8 ball with a plethora of responses and answers that do not repeat once. 

First round:
I hope to accomplish a fully working magic 8 ball that will answer any yes or no question

Test plan for first round:
I'll test each portion of the program bit by bit unil i can combind them. The user will input "Am I tall?" and the output will be: It is certain. 

Reflections and revisions:
I now want to edit the code so it doesnt repeat the same answer twice.

Next steps:
My next step is to write the code so it doesnt repeat twice.
